Everyone complains about how boring and easy APCS is. So why dont we add some flavor to it? This year, I will be attempting to write all homework methods in 1 line. Screw readability (as long as compiler reads)

This repo is mostly for fun (and maybe help my procrastination). Don’t expect clean code. After all, why write 10 lines of code when you can force it into one? 

Note: My teacher is not amused, but hey, it's all in the name of learning! And the code actually works XD
