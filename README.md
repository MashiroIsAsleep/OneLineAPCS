Everyone complains about how boring and easy APCS is. So why dont we add some flavor to it?

This repo is mostly for fun (and maybe help my procrastination). Donâ€™t expect clean code â€“ expect the absurd. After all, why write 10 lines of code when you can force it into one? ðŸ˜‰

Note: My teacher is not amused, but hey, it's all in the name of learning! And the code actually works XD
